      <p>
         The concept/idea for Beginner's Beat is to allow/support the beginner's
         in music to share their music that is not so perfect and get feedback,
         So they can understand the audience and create better music.
         Beginner's Beat also allows to add video because, If the beginner's want
         to share that how they created the music, they can share it better through video
         and they can also share some cool videos created by them, just for fun.
         This is the first version of Beginner's Beat, So its not that good. <br>
         Please give your feedback on Beginner's Beat and the Idea/concept. <br>
         Thank you.

      <p>
        For Beginner's Beat I used Django(Python Web Framework) for the backend and
        HTML5 and CSS3 for the frontend. There is one problem in Beginner's Beat
        as mentioned above, that whenever you Like, Unlike, Comment or Delete a Comment
        the Web Page will reload. I will fix this problem after learning JavaScript.
        The source code of Beginner's Beat is avalible on Github(link given below).
        If you find any bug(error) in Beginner's Beat then please tell/inform me about it,
        I will try to fix it as soon as possible. <br>

    <strong id="tip">Tip for Beginner's</strong><br>
    <strong>How to share about your music through video: </strong><br>
    1) By recording the screencast of the DAW(Digital Audio Workstation). <br>
    while playing the made music in it. <br>
    2) Create a Music video(real or animated) or lyrics video if you added a song. <br>
    3) Explaining how you created the music directly through video. <br>
    4) You can also share some cool videos created by you, just for fun.
