The concept/idea for Beginner's Beat is to allow/support the beginner's in music to share their music that is not so perfect and get feedback, So they can understand the audience and create better music. Beginner's Beat also allows to add video because, If the beginner's want to share that how they created the music, they can share it better through video and they can also share some cool videos created by them, just for fun. This is the first version of Beginner's Beat, So its not that good.

Tip for Beginner's
How to share about your music through video: 
1) By recording the screencast of the DAW(Digital Audio Workstation). 
while playing the made music in it. 
2) Create a Music video(real or animated) or lyrics video if you added a song. 
3) Explaining how you created the music directly through video. 
4) You can also share some cool videos created by you, just for fun.
